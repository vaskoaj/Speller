0.  an artificial word that is a synonym for silicosis - a lung disease caused by inhaling fine ash.
1.  it gets the resource usage for the script.
2.  16
3.  for easy of reading the code as well as consistancy of script
4.  The code iterates until the end of the file through each character in the file. Words are created by identifying the characters between spaces.
    If the characters are either part of the alphabet or apostrophies, then they are appended to current word. If the character that is grabbed
    corresponds to a digit, then the word is skipped over and a new word is started. Once a word has been completed without being broken by a digit,
    it is passed through the check function to determine if it is a valid word. If the word is invalid, it is printed and the misspelled word count
    is incremented.
5.  If fscanf was used, the code would still need to check each character to determine if it met the right criteria, effectively scanning every
    charater in the file twice. This would double the runtim of the script. By iterating through one character at a time, the code can then perform
    the additional actions as needed.
6.  In order to better telegraph solutions that can be implemented by the students.
